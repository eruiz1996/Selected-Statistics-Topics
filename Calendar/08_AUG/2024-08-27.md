## `git rm`
The command
```bash
git rm --cached file_name.ext
```
delete the `file_name.ext` file from the **remote repository**.

If you want to remove all the files with `.ext` extension use:
```bash
git rm --cached *.ext
```
**Notes**: 
1. You need to commit your changes
2. Your files will not disappear from your **local repository**

## Rename file/directory
1. Go to the local directory
2. Use `mv`
```bash
git mv old_file_name new_file_name
```
3. Add new file: 
```bash
git add new_file_name
```
4. Make commit
```bash
git commit -m "Rename file: old_file_name to new_file_name"
```
5. Make push
```bash
git push
```
