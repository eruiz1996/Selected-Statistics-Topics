# Purpose
- The `HAVING` clause is used to filter records that **have been grouped** by the `GROUP BY` clause.
- It is similar to the `WHERE` clause, but `HAVING` is used for groups, whereas `WHERE` is used for individual rows.
# Syntax
The basic syntax is:
```SQL
SELECT 
	field_1, 
	aggregate_function(field_2)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY field_1
HAVING condition
ORDER BY field_1;
```
## Difference between `HAVING` and `WHERE`
- **Placement**: The `HAVING` clause **must come after** the `GROUP BY` clause and before the `ORDER BY` clause, following the [[10.Order-execution]] (`Partial-I/Theory/10.Order-execution`)
- **Conditions**: The HAVING clause can include one or more conditions. These conditions can use [[05.Aggregate_functions]] (`Partial-I/Theory/05.Aggregate_functions`)
- **Main difference**: `WHERE` filters rows before grouping, while `HAVING` filters groups after grouping.
