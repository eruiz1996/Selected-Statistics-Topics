# Definition
An **expression in SQL** is a combination of one or more values, operators, and SQL functions that evaluate to a value. Expressions can be used in `SELECT` statements, `WHERE` clauses, and other SQL commands.
# Importance
Expressions enable complex calculations, data transformations, and condition checking within SQL queries, making the queries more powerful and flexible.
## Math operators
Math operators in SQL are used to perform arithmetic operations on numerical data.

| Symbol | Operation      |
| :----: | -------------- |
|  `+`   | Addition       |
|  `-`   | Subtraction    |
|  `*`   | Multiplication |
|  `/`   | Division       |
|  `%`   | Modulus        |

**Examples**:
```SQL
-- Adding two numerical fields
SELECT
	field_1 + field_2 AS sum_f1_f2
FROM table_name;
```
```SQL
-- Substracting two numerical fields
SELECT
	field_1 - field_2 AS diff_f1_f2
FROM table_name;
```
```SQL
-- combining different operations
SELECT
	-- taking average
	(field_1 + field_2)/2 AS average,
	-- taking the total
	field_1 + field_2 AS total
FROM table_name;
```
