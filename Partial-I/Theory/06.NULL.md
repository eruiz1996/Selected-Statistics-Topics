# Definition
`NULL` represents the absence of a value or an unknown value in a database field. **It is different from an empty string or zero**; `NULL` means that no data has been entered.

Handling `NULL` values correctly is essential for accurate data analysis and to avoid errors in queries. They affect aggregate functions and comparisons, so special care is needed when working with them.

## Inserting `NULL` values
The following syntax add a new record to `table_name` in which first field put `value_1` and in the second field a `NULL` value.
```SQL
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2) 
VALUES ('value_1', NULL);
```
## Operation
`IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` are conditions used in SQL to check for `NULL` values in a field.

**`IS NULL` syntax**
```SQL
-- Finds records where field is NULL
SELECT * 
FROM table_name 
WHERE field_name IS NULL;       
```

**`IS NOT NULL` syntax**
```SQL
-- Finds records where field is NULL
SELECT * 
FROM table_name 
WHERE field_name IS NOT NULL;       
```
