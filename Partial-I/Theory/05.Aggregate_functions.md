# Definition
Aggregate functions **perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value**. They are often used with the `GROUP BY` clause to group records that have the same values in specified fields.

**Notes:**
- Common aggregate functions include: 
	- `COUNT()`
	- `SUM()`
	- `AVG()`
	- `MIN()`
	- `MAX()`
- Aggregate functions ignore `NULL` values, except for `COUNT()`.
- They are useful for summarizing data, such as finding totals, averages, or counts.
- Depends on the function it is going to work with numeric and non-numeric values.
# Syntax
## `COUNT()`
Returns the number of records in `field_name`
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(field_name)
FROM table_name;
```

**Hint**: in order to know the number of records use:
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table_name;
```
**Works with numeric and non-numeric values**

## `SUM()`
Returns the sum of values in `field_name`
```SQL
SELECT SUM(field_name)
FROM table_name;
```
**Works only with numeric values**

## `AVG()`
Returns the average of values in `field_name`
```SQL
SELECT AVG(field_name)
FROM table_name;
```
**Works only with numeric values**

## `MIN()`
Returns the minimum value in `field_name`
```SQL
SELECT MIN(field_name)
FROM table_name;
```
**Works with numeric and non-numeric values** because takes the alphabetically order (for `TEXT`) and also works with <u>dates</u>.

## `MAX()`
Returns the maximum value in `field_name`
```SQL
SELECT MAX(field_name)
FROM table_name;
```
**Works with numeric and non-numeric values** because takes the alphabetically order (for `TEXT`) and also works with <u>dates</u>.

### Usage with `GROUP BY` clause
```SQL
SELECT field_name, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY field_name;
```
