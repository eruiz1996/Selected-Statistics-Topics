# Introduction
## Database Normalization
**Database normalization** is the process:
- Minimizes duplicate data (in any table)
- Allows the database to grow independently
If we want to make database normalization we need to study the Joins in SQL.
## Joins in SQL
With SQL joins we can join on a key field, or any other field. That is going to depend on the type of relationship among the tables.
\
There are three [relationships](03.1.Relations.png):
- One-to-one
- One-to-many
- Many-to-many
### `INNER JOIN`
Is the most common join and select the records in that have matching values in both tables.

The syntax is the following:
```SQL
SELECT 
	field_1, 
	field_2,
	...
	field_n 
FROM left_table
--------- join tables -----------
---------------------------------
INNER JOIN right_table 
ON left_table.id = right_table.id
---------------------------------
WHERE condition(s) 
ORDER BY field(s), ASC/DESC 
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```
**Note**: `left_table.id` is the key field with `right_table.id`
