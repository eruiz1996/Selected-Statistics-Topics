# Definition
Aliasing in SQL is a way to **temporarily** rename a table or a field in a query to make it more readable and easier to work with.

**Notes:**
- Aliases are temporary and only exist for the <u>duration of the query</u>.
- They are useful for simplifying complex queries, especially when dealing with multiple tables or fields with long names.
- Aliases can be used in `SELECT` statements, `JOIN` operations, and [**aggregate functions**](05.Aggregate_functions).
# Syntax
```SQL
-- Renaming fields
SELECT field_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;

-- Renaming tables
SELECT field_name
FROM table_name AS alias_name;
```

**Note**: The word `AS` is optional
```SQL
-- also works
SELECT field_name alias_name
FROM table_name;
```
