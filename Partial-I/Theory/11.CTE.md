# Common Table Expressions
The CTE's are temporary tables that help us in:
- Avoid <u>complex subqueries</u>
- Create more readable queries
- Improving query organization
## Syntax
1. Use `WITH` clause to define name
2. Define required query with `AS` (aliasing CTE)
3. Use CTE as a existing table
```SQL
-- 1. Define CTE name
WITH CTE_name AS
(
	-- 2. Define associated query
	SELECT
	WHERE
	GROUP BY
	HAVING
	ORDER BY
	LIMIT OFFSET
)
-- 3. Use as existing table 
SELECT
	field_1,
	field_2,
	...
	field_n
FROM CTE_name;
```
