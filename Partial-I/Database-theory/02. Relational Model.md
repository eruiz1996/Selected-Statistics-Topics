# History
- Companies used to use the **Hierarchical Model**
- <u>Problem</u>: large quantities of data.
- In 1970, Edgar F. Codd published the paper *"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks,‚Äù* theorized the relational model.
- In 1973, Don Chamberlin and Ray Boyce went to the San Jose Research Laboratory
	- Joined the **System R** with the Codd's model.
	- Called this project **Sequel** (Structured English Query Language)
- In 1974, Ray died.
- In 1976, a more complete Sequel language design was published.
- In 1977, because of the trademark issue (a product of a British engineering firm), they rename as **SQL** (Structured Query Language).

# SQL
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.
## Concepts
- **Record**: row that holds the data on an individual observation.
- **Field**: column that holds one piece of information about all records.
- **Table**: two dimensional object compound of *fields* and *records*.
	- Fields are set at database creation.
	- There is not limit to the number of records.
- **Relational database**: collection of related tables.
## Conventions
### Table names
Should be:
- In lowercase.
- Without spaces, use underscore (`_`) instead.
- Refer to a collective group, or to be plural.
- Different from other field names.
- Different from other table names.

Examples of bad names to refer a tables:
1. `Movies` *uppercase*
2. `mexican movies` *with space*
3. `movie` *singular*
4. See [*Example 1*](02.1.Examples.canvas)
5. See [*Example 2*](02.1.Examples.canvas)
