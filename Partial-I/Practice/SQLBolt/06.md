# Multi-table queries with JOINs
Practice after [[03.Joins]]

1. Find the domestic and international sales for each movie
```SQL
-- basic solution
SELECT
    title,
    domestic_sales,
    international_sales
FROM movies
INNER JOIN boxoffice
ON movies.id = boxoffice.movie_id;
```
```SQL
-- more redable
SELECT
    m.title AS title,
    b.domestic_sales AS domestic,
    b.international_sales AS international
FROM movies AS m
INNER JOIN boxoffice AS b
ON m.id = b.movie_id;
```
2. Show the sales numbers for each movie that did better internationally rather than domestically
```SQL
-- basic solution
SELECT
    title,
    domestic_sales,
    international_sales
FROM movies
INNER JOIN boxoffice
ON movies.id = boxoffice.movie_id
WHERE international_sales > domestic_sales;
```
```SQL
-- more redable
SELECT
    m.title,
    b.domestic_sales,
    b.international_sales
FROM movies AS m
INNER JOIN boxoffice AS b
ON m.id = b.movie_id
WHERE b.international_sales > b.domestic_sales;
```
3. List all the movies by their ratings in descending order
```SQL
-- basic solution
SELECT
    title,
    rating
FROM movies
INNER JOIN boxoffice
ON movies.id = boxoffice.movie_id
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```
```SQL
-- more redable
SELECT
    m.title,
    b.rating
FROM movies AS m
INNER JOIN boxoffice AS b
ON m.id = b.movie_id
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```
