# Deleting rows
1. This database is getting too big, lets remove all movies that were released before 2005.
```SQL
DELETE FROM
    movies
WHERE
    year < 2005;
```
2. Andrew Stanton has also left the studio, so please remove all movies directed by him.
```SQL
DELETE FROM
    movies
WHERE
    director = 'Andrew Stanton';
```
