# OUTER JOINs
1. Find the list of all buildings that have employees
```SQL
-- simple solution
SELECT DISTINCT(building)
FROM employees;
```
```SQL
-- Solution with LEFT JOIN
SELECT DISTINCT(building)
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN buildings
ON employees.building = buildings.building_name;
```
```SQL
-- Solution with RIGHT JOIN
SELECT 
	DISTINCT building
FROM buildings
RIGHT JOIN employees
ON buildings.building_name = employees.building;

```
2. Find the list of all buildings and their capacity
```SQL
-- simple solution
SELECT 
    DISTINCT(building_name),
    capacity
FROM buildings;
```
```SQL
-- LEFT JOIN SOLUTION
SELECT 
    DISTINCT(building_name),
    capacity
FROM buildings
LEFT JOIN employees
ON buildings.building_name = employees.building;
```
3. List all buildings and the distinct employee roles in each building (including empty buildings)
```SQL
SELECT
    DISTINCT(building_name),
    role
FROM buildings
LEFT JOIN employees
ON buildings.building_name = employees.building;
```
