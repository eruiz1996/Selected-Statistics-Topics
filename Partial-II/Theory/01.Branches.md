# Definition
- **Branch** is a pointer to a *snapshot* of your changes.
- Each branch represents a new and independent developing work.
- The main branch is `main` (before was `master`).

To see how it work a branch look in [[01.1.Git-branches.canvas|01.1.Git-branches]] (`II/Theory/01.1.Git-branches.png`)

## What are the benefits of branching?
Branching in Git allows developers to work on separate features or tasks independently, helping to keep the `main` codebase stable.


# Commands
1. Identify the current branch
```bash
git branch
```
2. Create a new branch called `<branch-name>`
```bash
git branch <branch-name>
```
3. Switches to the branch `<branch-name>`
```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```
4. Rename the branch `<old-name>` to `<new-name>`
```bash
git branch -m <old-name> <new-name> 
```
