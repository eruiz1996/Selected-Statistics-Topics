# Definition
- A time series is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at successive points in time, often with equal intervals between them (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
- Time series analysis involves examining these data points to identify *patterns*, *trends*, *seasonality*, and other temporal structures.
- The goal is to understand the underlying processes generating the data and to make predictions or **forecasts**.
# Applications
- **Finance and Economics**
	- <u>Stock Market Analysis</u>: Predicting stock prices, trading volumes, and market trends using time series models.
	- <u>Economic Forecasting</u>: Modeling economic indicators, unemployment rates, inflation, and interest rates.
- **Weather and Environmental Science**
	- <u>Weather Prediction</u>: Forecasting temperature, precipitation, and other weather conditions using historical weather data.
	- <u>Climate Studies</u>: Analyzing long-term trends in climate data to study changes in weather patterns.
- **Manufacturing and Supply Chain**
	- <u>Process Optimization</u>: Monitoring production processes to identify inefficiencies and improve quality control.
	- <u>Supply Chain Management</u>: Forecasting supply chain demands and optimizing logistics based on historical data.
# Components
## Trend
A trend represents the <u>long-term progression or direction of the data</u> in the time series. It can be *upward* (increasing), *downward* (decreasing), or *flat* (no significant change).
### Characteristics
- Trends are usually observed over a longer period and indicate a consistent pattern or shift in the data.
- They can be linear (steady growth/decline) or nonlinear (changing rate of growth/decline).
## Seasonality
Seasonality refers to <u>regular and repeating patterns in the data that occur at fixed intervals</u>, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly.
### Characteristics
- Seasonal effects are often influenced by calendar-related events, such as holidays, weather patterns, or economic cycles.
- These patterns are predictable and recur with the same frequency.
**Example**: An increase in retail sales during holiday seasons like Christmas or Black Friday.
## Cyclical Patterns
Cyclical patterns are fluctuations in the time series data that occur over longer, irregular periods, usually related to economic or business cycles.
### Characteristics
- Unlike seasonality, cyclical patterns do not have a fixed interval and can vary in duration and amplitude.
- They often depend on broader economic factors, such as market conditions, business cycles, or political events.
**Example**: Economic cycles like recessions, booms, and recoveries.
## Noise
Noise refers to <u>random variations in the time series</u> that cannot be attributed to *trend*, *seasonality*, or *cyclical patterns*.
### Characteristics
- These variations are unpredictable and do not follow any specific pattern or structure.
- Noise is often considered the "error" or "residual" part of the data.
## Time series decomposition
- Time series decomposition is the process of separating a time series into its fundamental components: trend, seasonality, and residual (noise).
- Decomposition can be additive or multiplicative, depending on how these components interact with each other.
### Additive
The time series is expressed as a sum of its components:
$$y(t) = Trend + Seasonalily + Noise$$
### Multiplicative
The time series is expressed as a product of its components:
$$y(t) = Trend \times Seasonalily \times Noise$$
